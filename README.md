# Foundry Consent Checklist VTT
Based on the Personalized RPG Consent Checklist, this System-Agnostic Module allows players to share their consent with others.

# Based on
The original idea for this checklist came from this Sideblog: https://mirthfulbrewist.tumblr.com/post/624280144839901184/rpgconsentchecklist

# Description
How this works is that when a user logs in, they will be given the option to access their Consent Form. They will be required to set a password (which will be required to access the full form and make changes from then on). Users then can select what they want to share, and how they want to share the information.

All users can view the Consent Table, which will show what the aggregate consent is for the table, and any kind of information that other players have shared with others. At any point in time, users may change their consent, and the consent table will be updated to reflect those changes.

# Encryption
This module uses an encryption method to store each user's settings. When you first initialize the form, it will ask you to set a password, which this will be used to encrypt the settings. 

**WARNING:** Encryption is one-way. If you lose the password, a GM will need to completely reset your form. Nothing will be saved, for safety purposes.

# Why the reversed permissions?
Tabletop Roleplay Games are an amazing thing to share with others. Its way to play into a role that you don't see you taking in real life. However, these roles can fall upon pitfalls, and sharing one's traumas can be... difficult. The reason why this module holds permissions with the users that fill out the form, rather than the GM. It gives the power to those that were hurt, and it allows people to be more candid with those they absolutely trust. Absolutely no one should be required to share the details of their trauma with others if they don't want to.
